    <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <cite>https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19344/homemade-lasagna/</cite>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.

    <h2>How to Make Homemade Lasagna:</h2>
    <p>
      Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full,
      step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can
      expect:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the meat:</b> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned
        and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent.
        Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil,
        1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the noodles:</b> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted
        water until they're al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make the cheese layer:</b> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs,
        the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Assemble the lasagna:</b> Layer the ingredients according to the
        recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the
        lasagna is assembled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bake the lasagna:</b> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven
        for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the
        top is golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna:</h2>
    <p>
      In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be
      perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes
      uncovered).
    </p>
    <h2>How to Store and Freeze Lasagna:</h2>
    <p>Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.</p><br>
    <p>If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow it to cool completely, then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap. Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or microwave.</p>
