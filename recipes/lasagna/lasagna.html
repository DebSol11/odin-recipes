    <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.

    <h2>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade
      lasagna recipe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Meat:</b> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat.
        <ul>
          <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
          <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Onion:</b> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground
        meat.
        <ul>
          <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Canned tomatoes:</b> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of
        crushed tomatoes.
        <ul>
          <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
          <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fresh herbs:</b> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley
        and crush one clove of garlic.
        <ul>
          <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
          <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sugar:</b> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the
        tomatoes.
        <ul>
          <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Spices and seasonings:</b> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with
        dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
        <ul>
          <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
          <li>3 ½ teaspoons salt</li>

          <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Noodles:</b> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe
        calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to
        save time.
        <ul>
          <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cheese:</b> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and
        Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
        <ul>
          <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
          <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Eggs:</b> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as
        a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
        <ul>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Homemade Lasagna:</h2>
    <p>
      Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full,
      step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can
      expect:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the meat:</b> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned
        and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent.
        Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil,
        1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the noodles:</b> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted
        water until they're al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make the cheese layer:</b> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs,
        the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Assemble the lasagna:</b> Layer the ingredients according to the
        recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the
        lasagna is assembled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bake the lasagna:</b> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven
        for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the
        top is golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be
      perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes
      uncovered).
    </p>
    <h2>How to Store and Freeze Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers
      to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to four days.
      Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow
      it to cool completely, then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap.
      Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up
      to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or
      microwave.
